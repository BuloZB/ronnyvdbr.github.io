# Raspberry-Wifi-Router

Welcome to the Raspberry-Wifi-Router project.
This project aims to build a descent Wifi Router out of a Raspberry Pi which is easily configurable via
a dynamic web interface designed in HTML/PHP.
This project came to life out of personal interest in hardware embedded design and software design in linux with PHP.
